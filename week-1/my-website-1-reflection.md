**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**
To create a repository, log into your Github account. Then, click on the "+" sign next to your account icon on the top-right of your screen and scroll down to "New repository". To clone this repository, copy the link on the right of your screen titled "HTTPS clone URL". Now in your shell, type in "git clone PASTE-URL-HERE", where PASTE-URL-HERE is a placeholder for the URL you just copied. There you have it!

**Describe what open source means.**
Open source is when you share how your program is made and allow anyone to work on the program.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
I really like the idea of Open Source! I do wonder what the limitations are on what changes people are able to make, e.g. is it easy for hackers to purposefully ruin an open source program? That concern aside, the ability to contribute to programs and recieve help from other programmers on a given project is exciting!

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**
Using liscences is important because it allows other programmers to gain access to and thus be able to help with your program. Since copyright is automatic in the U.S., no one else would legally be able to access your program without a liscence.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
This challenge helped solidify the whole process of getting files on Github using Terminal, i.e. creating a feature branch, adding, committing, pushing, pulling, merging and cleaning up the feature branch. I am struggling a bit with remembering each step. I realized I had accidentally committed my index.html file using the master branch instead of creating a new feature branch, so I had to use "git reset HEAD^" and create the new feature branch, then add and commit the file correctly.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
I was able to adequately complete this challenge using just the directions and resources provided.
