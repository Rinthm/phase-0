- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was really cool to see the page up on Chrome! And it was great to be able to see the changes in realtime by refreshing the page; it made checking the work much wuicker and easier. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

We didn't have to do a whole lot of researching, and when we did it was just to look up syntax information. I felt like the codecademy HTML course did a really great job of preparing me. When we were finished with the first draft, everything was working great; I just did a bit of extra editing for spacing and added the image and that's it!

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I'd say we did really well. We didn't do any styling to the text; I think the only thing we did that may be considered formatting is use <hr> to add a dividing line underneath the header.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It seems that HTML is really good for setting up structure of the website. It's really simple to use and I think the tags make it easy to remember proper format. The bad part of HTML is that it doesn't seem to have much designing capability; either that or it might be difficult to do in HTML.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

HTML has been really easy for me to use thus far, so I can't really think of any tricks. Perhaps when I start doing more complex HTML work I'll need to have a cheat sheet or something. :)
