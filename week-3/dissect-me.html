      <h3>Exploration of the command line, version control, git and GitHub.</h3>

        Hello there! This week I have learned how to do many things in the mysterious realm of the command line. I also picked up some sweet knowledge about using git, version control, and the awesome powers of GitHub! Let me take a few minutes to bestow some of this knowledge upon you!

        First, I'll describe some of the terms I just dropped. The "command line" is essentially the environment that allows a user to communicate with their computer - the user enters an input and the computer will produce an output! "Version control" is the process of keeping track of who makes changes to a program, when the changes are made, and the details of each change. "Git" is a popular version control system. "GitHub" is a website where programmers can store thier code. Okay! Now that we have a general idea of what we're looking at, I'll discuss why this is important.

        So let's say a team of programmers wants to work on a project together that is located on GitHub. We'll call the project "Master Project". Any given programmer can use their command line to access any of the files of Master Project using git commands. When they do this, they are essentially making a copy of the files onto their computer. Now they can make changes to the files without affecting Master Project. Once they are finished making their changes, they can do what is called a "commit", which is essentially a submission of their changes that can be reviewed before it is published. Thanks to the version control capabilities of git, any of the programmers working on Master Project can see who has made changes, when they did, and why. That is why these things are so important - any number of programmers can simultaneously work on a huge project with a bunch of files - all without messing each others' work up! This means a project can be finished faster, more thoroughly, and with unique input. It also makes programmers happier and more connected - they can even post a link to their project and ask for help from anyone on the internet who's interested!

        I hope this has helped you learn a bit about the fascinating world of programming. I know I still have an endless amount to learn, and I will update you as I continue to do so! :)

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I've used the <header>, <main>, and <section> tags often. These tags are pretty standard and any given HTML page will most likely have some kind of header, a main section, another section somewhere on the page.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out on a page in sections. These sections are defined by which tags you use. The browser starts with the broadest elements (e.g. <html> and <body>) and then narrows in, going linearly from the top of the page to the bottom of the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that Sublime is even more resourceful than I perviously thought! I learned about snippets, which can be used to quickly input information into a document by typing a phrase and pressing the tab key. I definitely think I will use more snippets! Especially when I learn what basic information is needed for different programming languages. While learning the inner workings of languages is important, I think shortcuts will be super important, so I will do some research on them as well.
